# ML application on Individual Investment Data
The goal of this project and competition is to introduce you to the process of solving a machine learning problem and working with real data(Individual Investment Data).
- Data Review
- Model Training & Testing

- Simplifying the model
- Competetion(train and predict on test data)
  - the *test_data_1.csv* and *test.py* are data(without labels) and standalone(process and train) 
- Ensemble learning
